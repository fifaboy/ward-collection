# Collection of Ward papers
This book is a collection of papers authored by Morgan Ward. Morgan Ward
may not be that well known among most of the students now a days but his
work has been really influential in many ways. He has some research results
in some very important and interesting areas, specially recurring series. He
authored 82 papers according to Lehmer [1]. The papers collected here are
kept as the original ones. However, there are some papers that I could not
get. By my count, I got 68 of those 82 papers here. A particular chapter
contains the papers published in that year.
An important note please do not use this book for any commercial
purposes. I do not own any copyright of the papers in any way. For adding
the missing ones to this collection or for any suggestion, feel free to contact
